# module-03-challenge
In module-03-challenge, I'm an employee who can access sensitive-data. To create password(s) meeting certain-criteria, I need to make a password-generator to generate strong, secure password(s).

Based-on my understanding, my tasks include:
- Making-sure pop-ups are presented to me, asking me to confirm which components I'd like to incorporate in my generated-password(s) and how long I'd like my generated-password(s) to be.
- Making-sure I can ONLY generate-password(s) between 08 characters and 128 characters.
- Making-sure my password(s) are generated ONLY when I answer ALL-of the pop-ups.
- Making-sure my generated-password is displayed on the webpage.

In script.js, I wrote comments before editing and/or adding code describing their intended-purpose(s).
